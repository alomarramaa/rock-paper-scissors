# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

+ This project implements the game from the Odin Project curriculm, which can be found at the followung URL: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors.
+ This game is playable by console.
+ The overall goal of the game is to learn the fundamentals of javascript, and tie them into the skills learned in HTML and CSS.
+ Creative liberty was used in designing this game! The overall structure is the same, but my own artistic elements were used to personalize it.
